        This is the <b>MPI Software Security group</b> lead by Dr <a href="https://mboehme.github.io">Marcel B&ouml;hme</a> at the Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy (MPI-SP) in Germany.
        We are interested in the automatic discovery of security flaws in software systems at the very large scale. 
        Some of us develop the probabilistic foundations of automatic software testing (i.e., finding bugs by generating executions) to elucidate fundamental limitations of existing techniques and to explore the assurances that software testing provides when no bugs are found.
        The other part of us develops practical vulnerability discovery tools that are widely used in software security practice. 
        For instance, Entropic is the default power schedule in LibFuzzer which powers the largest fuzzing platforms at Google and Microsoft,
        fuzzing hundreds of security-critical projects on 100k machines 24/7. His tools have discovered 100+ bugs in widely-used software systems,
        more than 70 of which are security-critical vulnerabilities registered as CVEs at the US National Vulnerability Database.
